Build Notes
-----------

While an Eclipse project is included, building with Ant instead is
recommended. Eclipse doesn't use the custom rules we have set up for
Ant build targets with respect to Google Maps API keys. You can still
test with Eclipse, but the map portion of the application may appear
as an empty grid.

On that note, be sure to create a local.properties (you can base it off
of ant.properties) and set maps.debug.key and maps.release.key to the
Google Maps API keys you want to use.
